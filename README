Many people use anonymous pseudonyms to send and receive mail that cannot be
traced to them. This program is for people who know what the pseudonyms
("nyms") are, understand how they work, and wish to make their use a little
easier. Antonym supports the following functions:

* Generating a create or modify block for a given reply path
* Decrypting a message sent to a particular nym
* Generating random passwords or text phrases
* Encrypting mails to be sent to nymservers
* Encrypting mails to be sent to anonymous remailers
* Calculating statistics about a given remailer chain

It's released and distributable under the terms of the GPL.

INSTALLATION

  Copy 'antonym.pl' to a directory in your $PATH.

  Get a .remailers file if you don't already have one.  An easy way to do
  this is:

    finger rlist@mixmaster.shinn.net > ~/.remailers

  Create your configuration file, 'replyblocks.dat'.  See the included
  'replyblocks.dat.example' for instructions.  This is probably the hardest
  part of using antonym, but it's not really *that* difficult, and you only
  have to do it when you're creating a new nym.  Hint: the 'phrase' and
  'password' commands can be helpful when writing your new reply block.


USAGE

  antonym has quite a few commands and options.  You can get a list of these
  by running antonym without any arguments.


EXAMPLES

  Creating a reply block:

    $ antonym --alias mynewalias create > newreplyblock.txt

  Decrypting a file that has been send to you:

    $ antonym decrypt infile.txt outfile.txt

  Reading a file that's been send to you, but without writing it out to a
  file:

    $ antonym decrypt infile.txt | less

  Calculating typical reliability and latency of the chain of remailers in
  your reply block:

    $ antonym chainstat dizum cracker austria
                        this hop           cumulative
    ##  remailer    latency     prob    latency     prob
    --  --------   --------  -------   --------  -------
     1  dizum       0:04:37  100.00%    0:04:37  100.00%
     2  cracker     1:02:13   95.11%    1:06:50   95.11%
     3  austria     0:06:24   99.96%    1:13:14   95.07%

    Probability of success: 95.07%
    Expected latency      : 1:13:14

  Encrypting an email you've written before sending it to your nymserver:

    $ cat email.txt
    From: mynewalias
    Subject: Another test
    To: kirk@strauser.com
    Gcc: nnml:sent.mail
    --text follows this line--
    Thanks for antonym!

    $ antonym nymcrypt email.txt


TODO

  Add support for:

    Encrypting a file to a remailer
    Verifying that reply blocks link to valid remailers
    Retrieving remailer info (~/.remailers)
    Generating random reply blocks
    Editing encrypted files (i.e. with a pipe to vi)
    Reading encrypted configuration files

  Finish moving *all* PGP/GPG interaction into wrappers


BUGS

  GnuPG support isn't even close to working.
