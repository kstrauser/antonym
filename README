Many people use anonymous pseudonyms to send and receive mail that cannot be
traced to them. This program is for people who know what the pseudonyms
("nyms") are, understand how they work, and wish to make their use a little
easier. Antonym supports the following functions:

* Generating a create or modify block for a given reply path
* Decrypting a message sent to a particular nym
* Generating random passwords or text phrases
* Encrypting mails to be sent to nymservers
* Encrypting mails to be sent to anonymous remailers
* Calculating statistics about a given remailer chain
